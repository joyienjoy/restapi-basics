A REST API exposes a set of public URLs that client applications use to access the resources of a web service. 
These URLs, in the context of an API, are called endpoints.

To help clarify this, take a look at the table below.


HTTP METHOD	  ----------    API endpoint	                  ----------      Description

GET	          ----------    /customers	                    ----------      Get a list of customers

GET	          ----------    /customers/<customer_id>	      ----------      Get a single customer

POST	                      /customers	                                    Create a new customer

PUT	                        /customers/<customer_id>	                       Update a customer

PATCH	                     /customers/<customer_id>	                         Partially update a customer

DELETE	                    /customers/<customer_id>	                       Delete a customer
